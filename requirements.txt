# Kubernetes Monitor Dependencies
# Core dependencies for Kubernetes monitoring

# PyYAML for YAML parsing (kubectl output sometimes uses YAML)
PyYAML>=6.0

# Optional: For enhanced JSON handling and data processing
# (The script uses built-in json module, but these can be useful for extensions)
# pandas>=1.5.0
# numpy>=1.21.0

# Optional: For advanced logging and monitoring
# prometheus-client>=0.14.0

# Optional: For web dashboard (if you want to extend the monitor)
# flask>=2.0.0
# flask-cors>=3.0.0

# Note: This script primarily uses subprocess to call kubectl commands
# and built-in Python modules (json, logging, datetime, dataclasses)
# The main requirement is having kubectl installed and configured
# to access your Kubernetes clusters.
